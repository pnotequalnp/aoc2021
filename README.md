# aoc2021
My personal Advent of Code 2021 solutions in Haskell. Uses my [Advent of Code
framework](https://github.com/pnotequalnp/advent-of-code).

## Usage
If you want to run them on your own inputs, you'll need to set the `AOC_SESSION_KEY` environment
variable, see the framework's readme for more details.
